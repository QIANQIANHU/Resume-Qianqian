<center>SUMMARY</center>

```
As a PM, I evangelized the customers voice and needs, drove appropriate product decisions based on both qualitative and quantitative data, /coordinated engineering and UX team, and managed timelines and deliverables. With the strong curiosity and passion for owning /projects end-to-end, building it from the ground up, and shipping it to customers through a dynamic and /interactive platform, I converted myself to be a developer. I have the eager to find the missing puzzle of a full products life cycle, /which for me is the understanding of code. Thus, I broke into this industry with a PM background. With the working /experience of a web developer, I know more of the magic and limits of technical, which now inspires me to /looking for opportunities to dive deeply in the development cycle.
